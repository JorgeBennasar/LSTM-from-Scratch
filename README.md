# LSTM  from Scratch

Low-level-programmed LSTM model with selectable connectivity features: percentage of connected neurons, type of graph (e.g.: Erdos Renyi, Watts Strogatz)...

I used this network to analyze the impact of connectivity on neural activity dimensionality, comparing the results with brain data retrieved from monkeys.
